# Pokémod

A small collection of Pokémon Red & Blue Gameboy game mods. You can download and play each mod online with [GameBoy Online](https://taisel.github.io/GameBoy-Online/) or any GBC emulator. Each mod is a branch of [pret/pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered).

- **Pleasant Town**: The road out of Pallet Town has been blocked. The game is transformed into a quaint life-simulator about a sleepy town. 
- **SNES Room**: Ash's room is full of Super Nintendo consoles.
- **Upside Down**: Player and pokémon sprites have been rotated 180 degrees.
- **Super Starters**: The three starting pokémon are Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur.
- **Bicycle Baller**: Start the game with a bicycle item on your home PC. Every shop in the game also has free Master Balls.
